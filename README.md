# Store_item_demand_forecasting

Given: 5 years of store-item sales data
Predict: 3 months of sales for 50 different items at 10 different stores.

The following three models were compared: 
- ARIMA 
- seasonal ARIMA
- Facebook Prophet

Due to the high cleaniness of the data (evidenced by EDA), all models yielded similar performances. 
Prophet slightly out competed ARIMA in terms of computation efficiency.
